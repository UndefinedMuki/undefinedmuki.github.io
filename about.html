        what is this about?<br>
        i don't know. it started with just a link farm and for me to have something to play with some javascript/css. <br>
        i don't exepct anyone to read this but i decided to add updates to my various projects i have going on.<br>
        i feel as if there was a crowd that is interested in updates it would motivate me to work on projects to completion.
